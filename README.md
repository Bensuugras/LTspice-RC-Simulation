# LTspice-RC-Simulation
LTspice simulation of RC circuit
# Circuit Details
Resistor (R): 1kΩ

Capacitor (C): 1µF

Voltage Source: 5V DC

# How to Run
Open the RC_Circuit.asc file in LTspice.

Click the "Run" button 

View the results in the waveform window.

# Additional notes:

The simulation shows the charging curve of the RC circuit

Expected time constant (τ) = R×C = 1ms

You can modify component values to see different responses
